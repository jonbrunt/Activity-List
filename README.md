# Activity List
An interactive activity list inspired by an assignment from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp, reverse engineered in my own code using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The app allows for the addition and removal of list items, and the ability to line through completed tasks, and to undo these line-throughs.
